# Video Deployment Issue - Summary & Solution

## 🔴 Current Problem

**Videos aren't working on your deployed Vercel site** because:

1. **Git LFS is not installed** - Your local machine doesn't have Git LFS installed
2. **Storage limit exceeded** - You have 1.5GB of videos but GitHub free tier only allows 1GB LFS storage
3. **Videos not tracked** - Videos may not be properly tracked by Git LFS yet

## 📊 Current State

- **Repository**: `https://github.com/Ian-mccallum/imanolvillagomez.git`
- **Video size**: 1.5GB total
- **Largest file**: 223MB (`2hollisLOLLA.mov`)
- **GitHub free LFS**: 1GB storage limit ❌
- **Vercel build**: Includes `git lfs pull` but LFS isn't configured

## ✅ Recommended Solution: GitHub Pro

**Why this is best:**
- ✅ Zero code changes needed
- ✅ 5-minute setup
- ✅ $4/month (reasonable cost)
- ✅ 50GB storage (plenty for 1.5GB)
- ✅ Works with existing Vercel setup

### Quick Steps:

1. **Upgrade GitHub** → https://github.com/settings/billing ($4/month)
2. **Install LFS** → `brew install git-lfs && git lfs install`
3. **Run setup** → `./setup-git-lfs.sh`
4. **Push** → `git push origin main`
5. **Done!** → Vercel will automatically deploy with videos

**Total time: ~15-20 minutes**

## 🔧 What's Already Configured (Good!)

✅ `.gitattributes` - Correctly configured for LFS
✅ `vercel.json` - Build command includes `git lfs pull`
✅ `package.json` - `vercel-build` script is correct
✅ Video references - All videos use `/videos/filename.mov` paths

**The only missing pieces:**
- Git LFS installation
- GitHub Pro upgrade (for storage)
- LFS migration of existing videos

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option A: GitHub Pro (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Upgrade GitHub (do this first!)
# Go to: https://github.com/settings/billing

# 2. Install Git LFS
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install

# 3. Run diagnostic to see current state
./diagnose-git-lfs.sh

# 4. Run setup script
./setup-git-lfs.sh

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 6. Check Vercel deployment
# Videos should now work!
```

### Option B: AWS S3 (If you want to save money)

See [git-lfs-fix-guide.md](./git-lfs-fix-guide.md) for detailed AWS S3 setup instructions.

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "git: 'lfs' is not a git command"
**Fix:** `brew install git-lfs && git lfs install`

### Issue: "LFS storage limit exceeded"
**Fix:** Upgrade to GitHub Pro or use AWS S3

### Issue: "Videos not loading on Vercel"
**Check:**
1. Vercel build logs - look for LFS errors
2. Browser console - check for 404 errors
3. Verify videos in `dist/videos/` after build

### Issue: "Build fails on Vercel"
**Check:**
1. `.gitattributes` is committed
2. Videos are tracked: `git lfs ls-files`
3. GitHub LFS quota not exceeded

## 📋 Verification Checklist

After completing setup:

- [ ] Git LFS installed: `git lfs version` works
- [ ] LFS initialized: `git lfs install` completed
- [ ] Videos tracked: `git lfs ls-files` shows all videos
- [ ] GitHub Pro active: Check billing page
- [ ] Videos pushed: Check GitHub repository
- [ ] Vercel build succeeds: Check deployment logs
- [ ] Videos load: Test deployed site

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**The fastest way to get videos working:**

1. Upgrade to GitHub Pro ($4/month) - 2 minutes
2. Install Git LFS - 1 minute
3. Run setup script - 2 minutes
4. Push to GitHub - 10-15 minutes
5. Done! Videos work on Vercel

**Total: ~20 minutes and $4/month**

---

## 💡 Why This Happened

Your videos are large (1.5GB) and GitHub's free tier only allows 1GB of LFS storage. Git LFS also wasn't installed locally, so videos couldn't be properly tracked. Vercel's build process tries to pull LFS files, but they weren't set up correctly.

**The fix is straightforward** - install LFS, upgrade GitHub storage, and migrate the videos. Then everything will work!

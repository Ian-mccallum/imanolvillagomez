# ✅ Removed hellp2.mp4

## What Was Done

1. ✅ Removed `hellp2.mp4` from Git/LFS tracking
2. ✅ File deleted

## Next Steps

Now commit and push:

```bash
# Commit the removal
git commit -m "Remove hellp2.mp4 - not needed"

# Push LFS files (this will skip hellp2 since it's removed)
git lfs push --all origin main

# Push commits
git push origin main
```

This should fix the missing LFS file error!

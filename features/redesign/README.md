# UI Redesign Planning Documents

This directory contains a comprehensive set of industry-standard planning documents for the UI redesign of Imanol Villagomez's videography portfolio website.

## Document Overview

### Core Planning Documents

1. **PRD (Product Requirements Document)** - `ui-redesign-prd.md`
   - Defines what to build and why
   - Target users, goals, success metrics
   - Feature specifications and requirements
   - Business objectives and timeline

2. **Design Document** - `redesign.md`
   - Comprehensive visual design system
   - Technical architecture and design decisions
   - Component specifications
   - Creative aesthetic (Carson-Oliver-West-Weirdcore methodology)
   - Implementation approach

3. **Requirements Mapping** - `ui-redesign-requirements-mapping.md`
   - Maps business requirements to technical requirements
   - Traceability matrix
   - Dependencies and constraints
   - Test coverage mapping

### User-Focused Documents

4. **User Stories** - `ui-redesign-user-stories.md`
   - User-centric feature descriptions
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Story mapping and prioritization
   - Personas and user journeys

5. **Use Cases** - `ui-redesign-use-cases.md`
   - Detailed user interactions
   - Scenarios and flows
   - Edge cases and exceptions
   - Activity and sequence diagrams

### Development Support

6. **Checklist of Atomic Steps** - `ui-redesign-atomic-steps.md`
   - Step-by-step implementation checklist
   - Task breakdown by phase
   - Dependencies and validation steps
   - 76 atomic implementation steps

## Key Design Principles

This redesign follows the **Carson-Oliver-West-Weirdcore** collaboration methodology:

- **David Carson**: Experimental typography, break rules, asymmetrical layouts
- **Vaughn Oliver**: Dark beauty, gothic elegance, distressed textures
- **Kanye West**: Minimalist perfectionism, bold statements, iconic design
- **Weirdcore**: Glitch as art, intentional digital artifacts

### Video-First Hierarchy (Non-Negotiable)

1. **VIDEOS (80% visual weight)**: Many appropriately-sized videos filling the page
2. **Video metadata (15% visual weight)**: Titles, descriptions, supporting info
3. **Navigation/branding (5% visual weight)**: Minimal, unobtrusive (PRESERVED AS-IS)

## Usage Workflow

1. **Start with PRD**: Understand what to build and why
2. **Review Design Document**: Understand the visual design system
3. **Read User Stories**: Understand user needs and features
4. **Review Use Cases**: Understand detailed interaction flows
5. **Check Requirements Mapping**: Understand technical implementation
6. **Follow Atomic Steps**: Implement step-by-step using checklist

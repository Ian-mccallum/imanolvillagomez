# Brainstorm

## Overview

**Unleash Move 37 thinking.** Based on everything above, generate progressively better ideas that escalate from obvious to extraordinary. This isn't casual ideation—it's systematic exploration of neglected solution spaces where breakthroughs hide.

Channel AlphaGo's legendary Move 37: the non-obvious play that experts initially dismissed but changed the game forever. End with Move 78: the decisive synthesis after deep search.

## Your Mission

Take the problem, feature, or challenge from above and produce **[N] progressively better ideas** (default: 7). Each idea must be demonstrably superior to the previous—climbing from safe and incremental toward frontier moves that redefine what's possible.

**Before generating any ideas: THINK DEEPLY.** Spend significant cognitive effort understanding the problem space. The quality of your brainstorm is directly proportional to the depth of your initial thinking.

## Phase 0: First Principles Excavation

**This is the foundation of everything.** Don't skip it.

### The Core Question

> "If we were designing this from scratch today—with no legacy, no path dependence, no inherited assumptions—what would we build?"

### Problem Decomposition

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PROBLEM ANATOMY                                                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. STATED PROBLEM: What was literally asked?                   │
│ 2. REAL PROBLEM: What's actually being solved?                 │
│ 3. ROOT CAUSE: Why does this problem exist?                    │
│ 4. PROBLEM BEHIND THE PROBLEM: What deeper issue lurks?        │
│ 5. SUCCESS CRITERIA: How do we know we've won?                 │
│ 6. ANTI-SUCCESS: What would failure look like?                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Evolutionary Baggage Analysis

**Most solutions aren't optimal—they're artifacts of history.** Ask for each existing approach:

| Current Approach | Why It Exists (Historical) | Is This Optimal or Path-Dependent? | What If We Designed From Scratch? |
|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| [Approach 1] | [Historical reason] | Optimal / Path-dependent | [First-principles alternative] |
| [Approach 2] | [Historical reason] | Optimal / Path-dependent | [First-principles alternative] |

**Key insight**: Evolution (biological and organizational) optimizes for "good enough to survive," not "best possible design." We can design *directly* for excellence.

### Constraint Autopsy

| Constraint | Real or Assumed? | Why We Believe It | What If It's False? | If Removed: What's Possible? |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| [Each one] | Real / Assumed / Unknown | [Evidence] | [Test to check] | [New possibility] |

**The mantra**: Most constraints are inherited beliefs, not physical laws.

### Stakeholder Rotation

Think from each perspective for 30+ seconds:

| Perspective | What Do They Need? | What Would Delight Them? | What's Their Biggest Frustration? |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 👤 End User | | | |
| 🛠️ Developer | | | |
| 💼 Business | | | |
| 🌍 Society | | | |
| 👹 Adversary | | | |
| 🔮 Future Self (5 years) | | | |
| 👶 Naive Observer | | | |

## Phase 1: Divergent Explosion

**Quantity over quality.** Generate raw material across ALL dimensions. We filter later.

### The 15 Lenses

| # | Lens | Prompt |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | 🎯 **Direct** | What's the most straightforward solution? |
| 2 | 🔄 **Inverted** | What if we did the exact opposite? |
| 3 | 🌊 **Adjacent** | What works in similar domains we could steal? |
| 4 | ⚡ **Compressed** | What if we had 1/10th the time? |
| 5 | 🔓 **Unlimited** | What if budget/time/tech were infinite? |
| 6 | 🎭 **Contrarian** | What do most people get wrong about this? |
| 7 | ⏱️ **Temporal** | What's the 10-year version? The 10-minute version? |
| 8 | 🚫 **Negative Space** | What are we deliberately NOT doing? Why? What if we did it? |
| 9 | 🔬 **10x Challenge** | What would make this 10x better, not 10% better? |
| 10 | 🎪 **Absurd** | What's the craziest solution that might actually work? |
| 11 | 🧬 **Biological** | How would nature solve this? Evolution? Ecosystems? |
| 12 | 👶 **Naive** | What would someone with zero domain knowledge try? |
| 13 | 🏛️ **First Principles** | If we designed from scratch today, what would we build? |
| 14 | ☠️ **Destroy** | What would make this problem disappear entirely? |
| 15 | 🔮 **Future Archaeology** | Looking back from 2035, what obvious solution did we miss? |

### Cross-Domain Mining

For each field, extract ONE transferable pattern:

| Domain | Pattern | Deep Mechanism | How It Applies |
|--------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| 🎮 Game Design | [e.g., progression loops] | [Why it works psychologically] | |
| 🧠 Behavioral Economics | [e.g., default effects] | [The underlying bias it exploits] | |
| 🏗️ Architecture | [e.g., load-bearing walls] | [The structural principle] | |
| 🎵 Music | [e.g., tension and release] | [The emotional mechanics] | |
| 🌿 Ecology | [e.g., keystone species] | [The systemic dynamic] | |
| ⚔️ Military Strategy | [e.g., asymmetric warfare] | [The power imbalance it creates] | |
| 🎭 Theater | [e.g., dramatic irony] | [The knowledge asymmetry] | |
| 🧪 Chemistry | [e.g., catalysis] | [Lowering activation energy] | |
| 🔬 Physics | [e.g., leverage/fulcrums] | [Force multiplication] | |

---

## Phase 2: Creative Operators

**Apply these systematically to generate non-obvious ideas.**

### Operator 1: Concept Splicing 🧬

Take two unrelated concepts and splice them like genes:

```
Concept A: [From your domain]
Concept B: [From completely different domain]

Splice 1: A's structure + B's mechanism = ?
Splice 2: A's purpose + B's form = ?
Splice 3: A's users + B's delivery = ?
```

### Operator 2: Orthogonal Creativity Jump ↗️

Force yourself to leap to dimensions completely unrelated to the original framing:

| Original Dimension | Orthogonal Dimension | What Emerges? |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Features | Emotions | |
| Technology | Ritual | |
| Efficiency | Beauty | |
| Individual | Collective | |
| Digital | Physical | |

### Operator 3: Latent Space Exploration 🌌

Imagine all possible solutions exist in a vast conceptual space:

1. **Where is everyone clustering?** (The obvious region)
2. **What's the opposite corner?** (The contrarian region)
3. **What's in the sparse areas between?** (The unexplored)
4. **What outliers exist at the far edges?** (The weird-but-maybe-brilliant)

**Mutation prompt**: Take your best idea and perturb it slightly along random dimensions. What emerges?

### Operator 4: Conceptual Wormholes 🕳️

Find instant connections between distant conceptual regions:

> "What distant field has already solved an analogous problem, even though it looks nothing like ours on the surface?"

| Distant Field | Their Problem | Their Solution | Our Analog |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| [Field 1] | [Problem] | [Solution] | [Application] |
| [Field 2] | [Problem] | [Solution] | [Application] |

### Operator 5: Novelty Ridge Walking 🏔️

Find the peaks of novelty that remain connected to usefulness:

```
                    NOVELTY
                       ↑
                      /\
           Too weird → ██ ← Still useful
                     /██\
                    /████\
        ──────────/██████████\──────────→ UTILITY

Walk the ridge: Maximum novelty that maintains practical value.
```

**Prompt**: "What's the weirdest version of this that would still work?"

### Operator 6: Constraint Alchemy ⚗️

Transform every constraint into a potential advantage:

| Constraint | Standard View | Alchemized View | New Possibility |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| [Constraint 1] | "This limits us" | "This could be our moat" | |
| [Constraint 2] | "This is a bug" | "This could be a feature" | |
| [Constraint 3] | "This blocks growth" | "This forces focus" | |

### Operator 7: Divergence Injection 💥

When ideas start converging too early, deliberately inject chaos:

- **Random word injection**: Pick a random noun. How does it relate?
- **Role reversal**: What if users were providers? Providers were users?
- **Time reversal**: What if we started from the end?
- **Scale shift**: What if this served 1 person? 1 billion people?
- **Medium shift**: What if this were physical? A game? A ritual?

## Phase 3: Progressive Ladder Construction

Now construct the ladder. **Each rung must be demonstrably better than the previous.**

The ladder is a GUIDE, not a prison. What matters is **progressive improvement**.

#### [#]. [EMOJI] [CATEGORY] — [Title]

- **The insight**: [Non-obvious realization that enables this]

## Phase 4: Ruthless Critique

**Kill your darlings.** Before finalizing, attack every idea:

### Pre-Mortem

For each top idea: "It's 6 months from now. This failed spectacularly. Why?"

### Cognitive Bias Check

| Bias | Check | Adjustment Needed? |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| Anchoring | Are we stuck on the first idea? | |
| Confirmation | Are we only seeing supporting evidence? | |
| Availability | Are we biased toward recent/memorable examples? | |
| Sunk Cost | Are we attached to ideas we've invested in? | |
| Optimism | Are we underestimating difficulty? | |
| Novelty Bias | Are we favoring new over proven? | |
| Complexity Bias | Are we overcomplicating for intellectual satisfaction? | |

### Steelman the Baseline

Before dismissing the obvious solution, ask:

> "What if we executed the baseline with absolute excellence, first-principles rigor, and relentless iteration? Would that actually be the best answer?"

Sometimes the Move 78 IS the baseline, done perfectly.

### The Reversal Test

For your top 3 ideas, argue the opposite position convincingly. What survives?

---

## Phase 5: Combinatorial Collision

**The best ideas emerge from collisions.** Take your top 3-5 ideas and systematically combine them:

```
Idea A × Idea B = ?
Idea A × Idea C = ?
Idea B × Idea C = ?
Idea A × B × C = ?
Constraint Flip × Move 37 = ?
First Principles × Cross-Domain = ?
```

**The question**: What emerges when you force unlikely combinations?

---

## Phase 6: Move 78 Synthesis

Compress everything into **one decisive move**:

### First Principles Synthesis Check

- [ ] This solution could only emerge from first-principles thinking (not incrementalism)
- [ ] We've shed evolutionary/historical baggage that constrained previous approaches
- [ ] We designed for the actual goal, not inherited assumptions
- [ ] The solution is elegant because it's fundamental, not because it's clever

### Creativity Synthesis Check

- [ ] We explored distant regions of solution space (not just local optimization)
- [ ] At least one non-obvious operator contributed to this (splice, wormhole, mutation)
- [ ] The solution has "why didn't we think of that?" quality
- [ ] It creates value in ways competitors can't easily copy

### The Final Checklist

- [ ] Combines best elements from multiple ladder rungs
- [ ] Removes everything non-essential (ruthlessly)
- [ ] Explainable in a single sentence
- [ ] Has asymmetric upside (limited downside, massive upside)
- [ ] Leverages unique constraints as advantages
- [ ] Creates cascading positive effects
- [ ] Is executable starting tomorrow

### The Final Test

> "If we could only do ONE thing from this entire brainstorm—and it had to emerge from first principles, leverage creative insight, be both ambitious AND achievable—what would it be?"

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Skipping first principles** — If you didn't question assumptions, you didn't think deeply
❌ **Surface-level creativity** — Using operators mechanically without insight
❌ **Premature convergence** — Don't stop when an idea feels "good enough"
❌ **False novelty** — Weird ≠ better; each rung must be demonstrably superior
❌ **Baseline dismissal** — The obvious solution done excellently might win
❌ **Abstraction escape** — Ideas must remain actionable, not pure philosophy
❌ **Constraint denial** — Acknowledge real constraints; only challenge false ones
❌ **Single-perspective thinking** — Rotate through stakeholders
❌ **Falling in love** — Kill your darlings ruthlessly
❌ **Operator tourism** — Don't apply operators for show; apply them for insight

---

## The Meta-Question

After completing the brainstorm, ask:

> "Is there a completely different way to frame this problem—based on deeper first principles or more distant creative connections—that would make our entire ladder obsolete and reveal an even better solution space?"

If yes, run another brainstorm on THAT framing.

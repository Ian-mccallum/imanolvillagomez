# Plan Feature

## Overview

**Architect creative excellence.** Based on the feature discussed above, create a world-class specification for a creative videographer's portfolio website. This isn't just planning—it's designing an experience that showcases unique, outside-the-box creative thinking.

## Your Mission

Take the feature concept from the conversation above and transform it into a rigorous, actionable specification. Think creatively about how to present video work in innovative ways while maintaining technical excellence.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Sequential Planning

**Plan components in logical order.** Each decision builds on previous ones. Planning out of order breaks the creative flow and technical coherence.

```
❌ WRONG: Design video player before knowing video sources
❌ WRONG: Create animations before defining layout structure
❌ WRONG: Build components before understanding user flow
✅ RIGHT: Understand requirements → Design experience → Build components
✅ RIGHT: Plan content structure → Design layout → Implement features
```

### Why Order Matters

Each planning phase informs the next:
- **Requirements** inform **architecture**
- **User experience** informs **component design**
- **Content structure** informs **layout decisions**
- **Technical constraints** inform **creative solutions**

## Planning Process

### Step 1: Understand the Feature

Before planning, clarify:
- **What** is this feature? (Video gallery, contact form, about page, etc.)
- **Why** does it exist? (Showcase work, capture leads, tell story)
- **Who** is it for? (Potential clients, collaborators, fans)
- **How** should it feel? (Bold, minimal, cinematic, interactive)

### Step 2: Define Requirements

Document:
- **Functional requirements** — What it must do
- **Creative requirements** — How it should look/feel
- **Technical requirements** — Performance, accessibility, browser support
- **Content requirements** — What content/assets are needed

### Step 3: Design the Experience

Plan:
- **User flow** — How users interact with the feature
- **Visual design** — Layout, typography, color, spacing
- **Motion design** — Animations, transitions, micro-interactions
- **Responsive behavior** — Mobile, tablet, desktop variations

### Step 4: Architect the Solution

Design:
- **Component structure** — What React components are needed
- **State management** — How data flows through the app
- **Performance strategy** — Lazy loading, code splitting, optimization
- **Accessibility** — ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen readers

### Step 5: Implementation Plan

Break down:
- **Development phases** — What to build first, second, third
- **Dependencies** — What needs to exist before this feature
- **Testing strategy** — How to verify it works
- **Content preparation** — What assets/content are needed

## Planning Checklist

- [ ] Feature purpose and goals clearly defined
- [ ] User experience flow mapped out
- [ ] Creative direction established (visual style, tone)
- [ ] Technical requirements documented
- [ ] Component architecture planned
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Accessibility requirements included
- [ ] Responsive design planned
- [ ] Content/assets identified
- [ ] Implementation phases defined
- [ ] Dependencies identified

## Feature-Specific Considerations

### Video Portfolio Features

When planning video-related features:
- **Video hosting** — Where videos are stored (Vimeo, YouTube, self-hosted)
- **Embedding strategy** — How videos are embedded (iframe, video tag)
- **Performance** — Lazy loading, thumbnail generation, progressive loading
- **Accessibility** — Captions, transcripts, keyboard controls
- **Mobile experience** — Touch controls, bandwidth considerations

### Creative Layout Features

When planning unique layouts:
- **Responsive behavior** — How layout adapts to screen sizes
- **Performance** — CSS animations vs. JavaScript animations
- **Browser support** — Modern CSS features, fallbacks
- **Accessibility** — Layout doesn't break screen readers
- **Content flexibility** — How layout handles varying content lengths

### Interactive Features

When planning interactive elements:
- **User feedback** — Visual/audio feedback for interactions
- **Performance** — Smooth animations, no jank
- **Accessibility** — Keyboard navigation, focus management
- **Progressive enhancement** — Works without JavaScript
- **Mobile touch** — Touch-friendly interactions

## Output Format

After planning, provide:

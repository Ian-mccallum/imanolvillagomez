# Feature Planning Templates

This directory contains industry-standard templates for feature planning and development. Use these templates to create comprehensive planning documents for new features.

## Template Overview

### Core Planning Documents

1. **PRD (Product Requirements Document)** - `prd-template.md`
   - Defines what to build and why
   - Target users, goals, success metrics
   - Feature specifications and requirements

2. **Design Document** - `design-document-template.md`
   - Technical architecture and design decisions
   - System diagrams and data models
   - Implementation approach

3. **Requirements Mapping** - `requirements-mapping-template.md`
   - Maps business requirements to technical requirements
   - Traceability matrix
   - Dependencies and constraints

### User-Focused Documents

4. **User Stories** - `user-stories-template.md`
   - User-centric feature descriptions
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Story mapping

5. **Use Cases** - `use-cases-template.md`
   - Detailed user interactions
   - Scenarios and flows
   - Edge cases and exceptions

### Operational Documents

6. **Runbook** - `runbook-template.md`
   - Deployment procedures
   - Operational runbooks
   - Troubleshooting guides

7. **Security** - `security-template.md`
   - Security requirements and threats
   - Threat modeling
   - Security controls and compliance

### Development Support

8. **Checklist of Atomic Steps** - `atomic-steps-checklist-template.md`
   - Step-by-step implementation checklist
   - Task breakdown
   - Validation steps

9. **Context for AI** - `context-for-ai-template.md`
   - AI-friendly feature context
   - Code patterns and conventions
   - Technical specifications for AI assistance

## Usage Workflow

1. **Start with PRD**: Define the feature at a high level
2. **Create User Stories**: Break down into user-facing features
3. **Develop Use Cases**: Detail specific interaction flows
4. **Map Requirements**: Connect business needs to technical specs
5. **Design Document**: Create technical architecture
6. **Security Review**: Identify and address security concerns
7. **Atomic Steps**: Create implementation checklist
8. **Context for AI**: Prepare AI assistance context
9. **Runbook**: Document deployment and operations

## Quick Start

1. Copy the relevant templates to your feature directory
2. Fill in the placeholders (marked with `[PLACEHOLDER]` or `<!-- TODO -->`)
3. Customize sections based on your feature's needs
4. Review and iterate with stakeholders
5. Use as living documents throughout development

## Template Customization

All templates include:
- Clear section headers
- Placeholder text for guidance
- Examples where helpful
- Industry-standard structure

Feel free to adapt templates to your team's specific needs while maintaining the core structure.
